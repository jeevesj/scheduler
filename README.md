# Interview Scheduler

## About Scheduler

The Scheduler project is a single-page appointment scheduling application built using React. The main goal of the project is to allow users to create, edit, and delete interview appointments while managing their schedules. The application interacts with an API server to persist data and keep track of appointments, interviewers, and days.

## Booking an appointment has never been easier!
